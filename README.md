# Feelings

Facial Expression Recognition
Guess whether these people are feeling good or not regarding their faces. üëç üëé

It is believed that a human has at least 8 basics emotions, where sadness and happiness are the ones the people usually talk more about. For the human being is kind of an easy job to find out how a person is feeling by the expression on their face. But this time you should train a Neural Network, using the layers and params you may find necessaries in order to get the highest accuracy, differentiating between sad and happy people.

You're right, people can feel more than one emotion at a time but, let's forget about it for a sec and try to simplify the problem.

The pictures are already in black and white, have a 48x48 size and have the faces cropped, what should makes everything a little easier. However, feel free to make any changes to the pictures, but remember to make the same kind of treatment to the train set of images and the test set of images, just before you make the predictions.

In case you don't already know, this is a problem of classification, with two classes.

Are you happy? Are you sad?
